# go version of not-quite-cargo

Not-quite-car**go**...

This is an AI rewrite of the python version which was then audited for bits
quite literally lost in translation. I would not trust this version as much as
the other one. Over time though, as i vet it more thougoughly, this will become
the default verion due to the ease cross compilation + binary size + it being 
only one binary.
